<summary>Day 1 - Monday</summary>

 - Created group **Slack** channel
 - Set up a project **Trello** workspace.
 - Brainstormed and came up with business concept: **PetSynth**, *AI assisted virtual pet generation*.
 - Created group project repository here on GitHub.
 - Set up a `prettier.rc` file in project root directory.
 - Utilized an existing *Vite* app and re-purposed by amending Router, Routes, file structure and associated *Nav* components in readiness for new development.
 - Created some core *Redux* code including *`initialState` and *Async Thunk* set up. We came to the decision it was a good idea to get this in fairly early, even though tricky if it requires amendment later.
 - [Deployed to Netlify](https://petsynth.netlify.app/)
 - Added some initial global css styles, primarily `border-box`, `font` and `color` variables

A little communication took place in **Slack**, mostly as a place to share the odd code snippet, image , otherwise we spent most of the day co-coding via **Google Meet** video conference, taking it in turns to write code under the "assistive direction" of the other team members
