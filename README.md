<summary>Day 1 - Monday</summary>

-   Created group **Slack** channel
-   Set up a project **Trello** workspace.
-   Brainstormed and came up with business concept: **PetSynth**, _AI assisted virtual pet generation_.
-   Created group project repository here on GitHub.
-   Set up a `prettier.rc` file in project root directory.
-   Utilized an existing _Vite_ app and re-purposed by amending Router, Routes, file structure and associated _Nav_ components in readiness for new development.
-   Created some core _Redux_ code including `initialState` and _Async Thunk_ set up. We came to the decision it was a good idea to get this in fairly early, even though tricky if it requires amendment later.
-   [Deployed to Netlify](https://petsynth.netlify.app/)
-   Added some initial global css styles, primarily `border-box`, `font` and `color` variables

A little communication took place in **Slack**, mostly as a place to share the odd code snippet or image, otherwise we spent most of the day co-coding via **Google Meet** video conference, taking it in turns to write code under the "assistive direction" of the other team members

<summary>Day 2 - Tuesday</summary>

-   Added content to Header, styled the Nav a little and integrated into the header.
-   Created Footer and introduced style.
-   Decided to take larger components to get some content up and working faster: Conrad took _Home_, Nico took _About_ and Susannah did some work on both _Ask_ and _Store_.
-   Encountered a few challenges today in different approaches to working methods and processes, so have been needing to increase awareness of getting used to each other and compromising.
